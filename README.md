# Weather Info

**Weather Info** is a Flutter application that provides real-time weather data for a given location (latitude and longitude) and date. The app leverages the OpenWeatherMap API and allows users to toggle between metric and imperial units to view the temperature and other weather conditions.

## Features

- Fetches real-time weather data based on geographic coordinates.
- Displays weather conditions, including temperature, description, and icon.
- Toggle between metric (°C) and imperial (°F) units.
- Displays error messages when data retrieval fails.
- Built using clean architecture principles with a separation between the data layer (API client), domain layer (repository), and UI layer (widgets).
